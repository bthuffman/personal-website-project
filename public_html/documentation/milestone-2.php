		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
		<p>My Professional Website Project will consist of one page with the following sections:</p>
		<p><Strong>Navigation:</Strong> This bar will include my name and a nav selection to the other sections which
		collapses into a hamburger button when the viewport shrinks. I would like this navigation bar to be fixed and
		follow the user as they scroll down the page. </p>
		<p><strong>Introduction:</strong>  This section will contain some stylized text including a short welcome, my name,
			career goals (web developer | web designer), a link to my contact me section (see description below) and links
		to my github and linked in. </p>
		<p><strong>About Me:</strong> This will contain a short heading like "Create. Augment. Repeat." followed by a
		paragraph briefly showcasing my strengths, personality, and aspirations. </p>
		<p><strong>Skills:</strong> an overview of a few of my top skills each with a heading followed by short description detailing each.
		One of these skills will be coding languages.</p>
		<p><strong>Experience:</strong> This section will detail the most pertinent job and educational experiences that
		expand my abilities into the field of software development. This is meant to highlight only a few so I might attach
		a link to my full resume here. I would like to have the logo of the companies I worked for here which when clicked
		opens up a new tab with their homepage. </p>
		<p><strong>Contact Me:</strong>This section will contain a standard and secure contact form followed by the footer
			which will contain my email address, additional links to my github and linkedIn. </p>
