			appealing format. </p>

		<h1>Persona</h1>
		<p>Maya Peterson, Human Resources Manager at Urban Sourcing. Maya is 35 years old with 10 years of experience
			looking for front-end and back-end web developers with experience in the latest web languages including HTML 5,
			CSS 3, JavaScript ES6, MySql 5.7, PHP 7.2, Bootstrap 4, and Angular 6. She is enthusiastic and driven to hire
			the best talent. Having hired successful Deep Dive Coding alumni in the past she is always excited to speak to
			talented graduates from the program. To verify candidates skills she often looks at their personal projects to
			assess their strengths and weaknesses. This is her primary reason for visiting my site today.</p>
		<p>Due to the front-end nature of my personal web project she will primarily be looking at the execution of the
			corresponding languages including HTML 5, CSS 3, Bootstrap 4, jQuery, Javascript, UX & UI Design, and built in
			securities for the site. After a thorough examination of the technical prowess, style, and quality of the site,
			Maya will have a greater understanding of my capabilities as a web developer and my suitability for various
			positions at Urban Sourcing. She gets frustrated when the website has a slow upload, a design that isn't
			particularly user friendly, lacks visual appeal, isn't easy to read or demonstrates inconsistencies between
			coding styles and frameworks. If I can pass through all these filters unscathed she'll likely want to
			check out the other projects on my github to help her make a final evaluation. </p>
