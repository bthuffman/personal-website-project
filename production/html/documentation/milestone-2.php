		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
		<p>My Professional Website Project will consist of one page with the following sections:</p>
		<p><Strong>Navigation:</Strong> This bar will include my name and a nav selection to the other sections which
		collapses into a hamburger button when the viewport shrinks. I would like this navigation bar to be fixed and
		follow the user as they scroll down the page on desktop sized viewports. </p>
		<p><strong>Introduction:</strong>  This section will contain some stylized text including a short welcome, my name,
			career goals (web developer | web designer), a link to my contact me section (see description below) and links
		to my github and linked in. There will also be a large background image of Lake Tahoe or one of my other favorite
		US lakes.</p>
		<p><strong>About Me:</strong> This will contain a short heading like "Create. Augment. Repeat." followed by a
		paragraph briefly showcasing my strengths, personality, and aspirations. </p>
		<p><strong>Skills:</strong> An overview of a few of my top skills that highlight my ability to succeed in the software
			development industry. Each skill will have a heading followed by short description detailing them.
		One of these skills will be coding languages and I will rate my proficiencies with various languages in a format that is
			easily readable at a glance.</p>
		<p><strong>Experience:</strong> This section will detail my most pertinent job and educational experiences that
		relate to software development. This is meant to highlight only a few so I might attach
		a link to a pdf of my resume here. I would like to have the logo of the companies I worked for here which when clicked
		opens up a new tab with their homepage. I am also considering making this field more like a cover flow. This means
			that the user could click left and right arrows in order to scroll through the covers each of which would
			detail one of my many previous jobs and educational experiences. </p>
		<p><strong>Contact Me:</strong>This section will contain a standard and secure contact form followed by the footer
			which will contain a link to my email address, github and linkedIn. </p>
		<h2>Wireframes</h2>
		<p>This site will be built following a mobile first strategy and will be fully responsive on both small and
		large screens. The following wireframes were created on <a href="http://balsamiq.com">https:balsamiq.com</a>.</p>
