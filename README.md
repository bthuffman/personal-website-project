## Milestone 2a
Your Milestone 2a looks really great! You have a very detailed content strategy that outlines all the possibilities for your different sections. I really like your plans to have a contact me link at the top of the page, as that mirrors a lot of corporate sites and is an effective strategy. I think in some ways it will be a lot of work to include many items from your resume on your website in addition to a list of skills, but your plan seems thoughtful to the design and effectiveness of these sections so I think you can make it work well.

Rating yourself on skills is also a somewhat risky but highly helpful thing to include for employers looking at your site to know quickly where you feel you stand on things. Striking a good balance between accurate and confident is really important here.

Your HTML looks great and you turned it in early, so your Milestone 2a passes easily at a Tier IV! Nice job!
