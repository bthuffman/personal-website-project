## Milestone 1 Feedback

Your purpose is clear but your audience and goal needs more detail. The more detail you provide for these obectives, you will be able gain an understanding out of how your UI concepts will fall into place with your design. It would be great if you could elaborate on your audience a little more by giving specifics on the types of employers and customers your are looking to work with. Also, elaborate when you speak  of "progressive company" because your definiton could me something entirely different from another person's definition. As far as your persona goes, it seems well detailed in certain areas but it also lacks in other areas. Please see attached link for a sample milestone 1. Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks good.

Your Milestone 1 is currently at a Tier I because of it is incomplete. Please do a resubmission for an upgrade to a Tier II and include the following:
A better detailed audience and goal
A picture for persona.
Technology section for persona

We look forward to seeing improvements heading into the next phase of development. If you are unclear or uncertain, feel free to ask the bridge for further explanation
