## Milestone 1 Feedback

Your purpose is clear but your audience and goal needs more detail. The more detail you provide for these obectives, you will be able gain an understanding out of how your UI concepts will fall into place with your design. It would be great if you could elaborate on your audience a little more by giving specifics on the types of employers and customers your are looking to work with. Also, elaborate when you speak  of "progressive company" because your definiton could me something entirely different from another person's definition. As far as your persona goes, it seems well detailed in certain areas but it also lacks in other areas. Please see attached link for a sample milestone 1. Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks good.

Your Milestone 1 is currently at a Tier I because of it is incomplete. Please do a resubmission for an upgrade to a Tier II and include the following:
A better detailed audience and goal
A picture for persona.
Technology section for persona

We look forward to seeing improvements heading into the next phase of development. If you are unclear or uncertain, feel free to ask the bridge for further explanation 

## Milestone 2a
Your Milestone 2a looks really great! You have a very detailed content strategy that outlines all the possibilities for your different sections. I really like your plans to have a contact me link at the top of the page, as that mirrors a lot of corporate sites and is an effective strategy. I think in some ways it will be a lot of work to include many items from your resume on your website in addition to a list of skills, but your plan seems thoughtful to the design and effectiveness of these sections so I think you can make it work well.

Rating yourself on skills is also a somewhat risky but highly helpful thing to include for employers looking at your site to know quickly where you feel you stand on things. Striking a good balance between accurate and confident is really important here.

Your HTML looks great and you turned it in early, so your Milestone 2a passes easily at a Tier IV! Nice job!
